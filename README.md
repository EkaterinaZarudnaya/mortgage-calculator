# MortgageCalc

## How to start project

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```
2. When you have NPM on your computer, you can proceed to install Angular CLI by typing the following into the terminal

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
This will download and install the latest Angular CLI to your system. Once installed, you can check your version by typing:

```
ng version
```
This will confirm if itâ€™s globally installed on your system and display the version installed (which should be the latest).


3. To run the server you should got to the folder `mortgage-calc` and use command:
```
npm start
```

By default project starts in http://localhost:8000

4. To run the project you should got to the  folder `mortgage-calc-server` and use command:
```
